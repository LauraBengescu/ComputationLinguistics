Viterbi algorithm and Naive Bayes both run from the class Apply. 
Apply will create the necessary algorithms and run them, returning the average accuracies for both using cross validation. 
It returns average accuracy for Viterbi without any unknown words (90-91%), then for Viterbi with unknown words (88-89%) and then 
for Naive Bayes (89.5).
